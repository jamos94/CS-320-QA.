How do I approach designing software?
- There are many strategies for software design. 
- Depending on the application, the correct strategy may vary. 
- Structured designs conceptualize a problem into several elements of a solution. When using this design, the designer can concentrate on the problem more accurately. 
-  Object Oriented Design focused on entities and characteristics. 
-  Bottom-up strategy is suitable for a system created from an existing system. 
-  Top-down design is suitable when a software solution needs to be designed from scratch
-  To choose the most efficient approach, understand the functions of the application and consider what approach bet suits the software.
