The source code creates an applciation that collects data including contact infomoration and  appointment information. 
Then JUnit testing is ran on the Java files to ensure functionality. 

Ensure that code is functional and secure by following protocols and requirements. In this case, we are using JUnit testing to help ensure the code is functional and secure. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- Asking questions and understanding who the users will be, how they will use the application, and the context of their work. 
- Develop requirements based on user needs once you understand how they will use the application. 
- Be sure to consider all users including clients, workers, and technical support. 

How do I approach designing software?
- There are many strategies for software design. 
- Depending on the application, the correct strategy may vary. 
- Structured designs conceptualize a problem into several elements of a solution. When using this design, the designer can concentrate on the problem more accurately. 
-  Object Oriented Design focused on entities and characteristics. 
-  Bottom-up strategy is suitable for a system created from an existing system. 
-  Top-down design is suitable when a software solution needs to be designed from scratch
-  To choose the most efficient approach, understand the functions of the application and consider what approach bet suits the software.
